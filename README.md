# Polyglot Meetup

This is the code to run the website www.polyglotmeetup.ca.

It's a monorepo microservice architecture.
I.e. there is two services (api and app) in one git repository.

for details on how either service works, read their respective readmes:
 - [API's Readme](./api/README.md)
 - [APP's Readme](./app/README.md)
